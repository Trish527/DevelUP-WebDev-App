# From the Vault: DevelUP Web Dev Challenge
A web development-based project that aims to challenge students' web development skills and abilities in collaboration with the PLM-Computer Science Society: DevelUP 2025 App Development Exhibit. 

## Requirements
1. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. If none, kindly follow the tutorial on how to install [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC56yUZCKu4).
2. After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) should be installed on the file directory. 

>Installation via Terminal:
```bash
npm install express
npm install cors --save
```

## Setup Guide
1. Go to the local file directory where the repository is saved (C:\USERS\DevelUP-WebDev-App).
2. Open up the terminal in admin mode in this directory. Ensure you follow these steps to connect the website via localhost. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not run the website via VS Code. It will open another local port on your computer.

```bash
node server.js
```
