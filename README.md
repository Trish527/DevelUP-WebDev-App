4. Node.js
5. Express.js

## Requirements
1. You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. If none, kindly follow the tutorial on how to install [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC56yUZCKu4).
2. After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) should be installed on the file directory. 

>Installation via Terminal:
```bash
npm install express
npm install cors --save
```

## Setup Guide
